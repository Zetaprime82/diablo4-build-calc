# frequently asked questions

## Where does this data come from?
With a few exceptions: I datamine everything directly from the game, myself.

You can use [CASCExplorer](https://github.com/WoW-Tools/CASCExplorer) to extract your own copy of the game assets.

Parsing the proprietary file formats within is an exercise left to the reader. The tools I use for this are not currently public.

I recommend starting with the ``.stl`` files if you want to see whether or not this is something you're comfortable doing, as they're one of the easiest formats to understand. For comparison, ``.pow`` files are one of the hardest.
