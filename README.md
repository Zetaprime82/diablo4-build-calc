# frequently asked questions

## Where does this data come from?
With a few exceptions: I datamine everything directly from the game, myself.

You can use [CASCExplorer](https://github.com/WoW-Tools/CASCExplorer) to extract your own copy of the game assets.

Parsing the proprietary file formats within is an exercise left to the reader. The tools I use for this are not currently public.

I recommend starting with the ``.stl`` files if you want to see whether or not this is something you're comfortable doing, as they're one of the easiest formats to understand. For comparison, ``.pow`` files are one of the hardest.

## Can I give you money for this?
You're free to do whatever you want, I do have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lothrik). I'm not selling you anything though.

## I found a bug or error, should I report it?
Yes, you should. I don't even particularly care how you do that. I've had people report bugs to me **in-game** of all places.
